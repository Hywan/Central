Hoa is a **modular**, **extensible** and **structured** set of PHP libraries.
Moreover, Hoa aims at being a bridge between industrial and research worlds.

# Hoa\Eventsource ![state](http://central.hoa-project.net/State/Eventsource)

This library allows to manipulate the
[EventSource](http://w3.org/TR/eventsource/) (aka Server-Sent Events) technology
by creating a server.

## Installation

With [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), to include this library into your
dependencies, you need to require
[`hoa/eventsource`](https://packagist.org/packages/hoa/eventsource):

```json
{
    "require": {
        "hoa/eventsource": "~3.0"
    }
}
```

Please, read the website to [get more informations about how to
install](http://hoa-project.net/Source.html).

## Quick usage

We propose as a quick overview to send an unlimited number of events from the
server to the client. The client will display all received events. Thus, in
`Server.php`:

```php
$server = new Hoa\Eventsource\Server();

while (true) {
    // “tick” is the event name.
    $server->tick->send(time());
    sleep(1);
}
```

And in `index.html`, our client:

```html
<pre id="output"></pre>
<script>
var output = document.getElementById('output');

try {
    var source    = new EventSource('Server.php');
    source.onopen = function () {
        output.appendChild(document.createElement('hr'));

        return;
    };
    source.addEventListener('tick', function (evt) {
        var samp       = document.createElement('samp');
        samp.innerHTML = evt.data + '\n';
        output.appendChild(samp);

        return;
    });
} catch (e) {
    console.log(e);
}
</script>
```

Start your HTTP server and then open `index.html`.

The `Hoa\Eventsource\Server::setReconnectionTime` method allows to redefine the
time before the client will reconnect after a disconnection. The
`Hoa\Eventsource\Server::getLastId` method allows to retrieve the last ID sent
to the client.
