Hoa is a **modular**, **extensible** and **structured** set of PHP libraries.
Moreover, Hoa aims at being a bridge between industrial and research worlds.

# Hoa\Fastcgi ![state](http://central.hoa-project.net/State/Fastcgi)

This library allows to manipulate the [FastCGI](http://fastcgi.com/) protocol,
which ensures the communication between a HTTP server and an external program
(such as PHP).

## Installation

With [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), to include this library into your
dependencies, you need to require
[`hoa/fastcgi`](https://packagist.org/packages/hoa/fastcgi):

```json
{
    "require": {
        "hoa/fastcgi": "~3.0"
    }
}
```

Please, read the website to [get more informations about how to
install](http://hoa-project.net/Source.html).

## Quick usage

As a quick overview, we propose to execute a PHP file through the FastCGI
protocol directly.

Before starting, we need to know that PHP proposes two tools that support
FastCGI: `php-cgi` and `php-fpm` (for
[FastCGI Process Manager](http://php.net/install.fpm)). We will use `php-cgi` in
local with the standard port `9000` in TCP:

```sh
$ php-cgi -b 127.0.0.1:9000
```

First, we write the `Echo.php` file, the one we are likely to execute:

```php
<?php

echo 'foobar';
```

Second, we need to open a connexion to the FastCGI server and send a query with
the following headers:

  * `SCRIPT_FILENAME` which represents the absolute path to the PHP file to
    execute;
  * `REQUEST_METHOD` which represents the HTTP method among `GET`, `POST`,
    `PUT`, `DELETE` etc.;
  * `REQUEST_URI` which represents the identifier of the resource we are trying
    to access.

Thus:

```php
$fastcgi = new Hoa\Fastcgi\Responder(
    new Hoa\Socket\Client('tcp://127.0.0.1:9000')
);
var_dump($fastcgi->send([
    'REQUEST_METHOD'  => 'GET',
    'REQUEST_URI'     => '/',
    'SCRIPT_FILENAME' => __DIR__ . DS . 'Echo.php'
]));
// string(6) "foobar"
```

We can get the headers from the executed file by calling the
`Hoa\Fastcgi\Responder::getResponseHeaders` method.

This is a good and fast way to execute PHP files (or other programs that support
FastCGI) without worry about binaries location, sub-shells calls, errors
handling etc.
