Praspel (PHP Realistic Annotation and Specification Language) is a formal
specification language for PHP. It is based on the design-by-contract paradigm
and uses preconditions, postconditions, invariants etc. Specifications are
written in the comments of the PHP code (always accessible). Praspel is used for
manual or automatic software validation and verification, thanks to realistic
domains.

This library contains compiler, interpreter, visitors, iterators and other tools
around the Praspel language.
