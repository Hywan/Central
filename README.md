# Hoa\Dns ![state](http://central.hoa-project.net/State/Dns)

This library allows to create a domain name resolver.

## Installation

With [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), to include this library into your
dependencies, you need to require
[`hoa/dns`](https://packagist.org/packages/hoa/dns):

```json
{
    "require": {
        "hoa/dns": "~3.0"
    }
}
```

Please, read the website to [get more informations about how to
install](http://hoa-project.net/Source.html).

## Quick usage

As a quick overview, we propose to create our own resolution server for the top
level domain `.hoa`. We start by modifying the local resolver in order to add a
new resolution host: ours.

### Specify a resolution server

On Mac OS X, the simplest way is to write in `/etc/resolver/hoa` the following
declarations:

```
nameserver 127.0.0.1
port 57005
```
 
On Linux, we will use [DNSMasq](http://thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html)
(often already installed). Then, we edit the file `/etc/dnsmasq.conf` by adding:
 
```
server=/hoa/127.0.0.1#57005
```

And do not forget to restart:

```sh
$ sudo /etc/init.d/dnsmasq restart
 * Restarting DNS forwarder and DHCP server dnsmasq    [OK]
```

For Windows, it is more complicated. You should read the documentation.

### Create a resolution server

Well, now, we will create our resolution server that will listen
`127.0.0.1:57005` (`57005` = `0xDEAD`) in UDP. Thus, in the `Resolution.php`
file:

```php
$dns = new Hoa\Dns\Resolver(
    new Hoa\Socket\Server('udp://127.0.0.1:57005')
);
$dns->on('query', function (Hoa\Event\Bucket $bucket) {
    $data = $bucket->getData();

    echo
        'Resolving domain ', $data['domain'],
        ' of type ', $data['type'], "\n";

    return '127.0.0.1';
});
$dns->run();
```

All query for the top level domain `.hoa` will be resolved to `127.0.0.1` (note:
we do not look at the type, which should be `A` or `AAAA` respectively for IPv4
and IPv6).

Finally, let say we have a HTTP server that runs on `127.0.0.1:8888` and the
index responds `yeah \o/`, then we start our resolver:

```sh
$ php Resolver.php
```

And we make an HTTP request on `foo.hoa` (that will be resolve to `127.0.0.1`):

```sh
$ curl foo.hoa --verbose
* About to connect() to foo.hoa port 80 (#0)
*   Trying 127.0.0.1... connected
* Connected to foo.hoa (127.0.0.1) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/a.b.c (…) libcurl/d.e.f
> OpenSSL/g.h.i zlib/j.k.l
> Host: foo.hoa:80
> Accept: */*
>
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Date: …
< Server: …
< Content-Type: text/html
< Content-Length: 8
<
yeah \o/
* Connection #0 to host foo.hoa left intact
* Closing connection #0
```

We see that `foo.hoa` is resolved to `127.0.0.1`!
